## Versioning

Using [version control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control) to track changes in your code and tagging releases when you've reached a milestone makes it easier to collaborate with others.

Keeping a [changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) gives transparency into what has changed.
